## About Marionette.Toolkit

Marionette.Toolkit is a collection of opinionated extensions for
[Marionette](http://marionettejs.com) Each element helps to reduce boilerplate
for complex large scale application problems.  This toolkit was
built from scripts open sourced from [RoundingWell.com](http://roundingwell.com).

In addition to the full library, each element in Toolkit is available as it's own [npm module](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/marionette.toolkit-modularized).

#### Changelog

For change logs and release notes, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) file.

#### Compatibility and Requirements

Marionette.Toolkit currently requires [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com) 2.2.0+ as it utilizes [`Marionette.Error`](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/v2.2.0/src/marionette.error.js) and extends
[`Marionette.Object`](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.object.md)

It's possible this library would work with earlier versions by manually adding `Marionette.Error` and shimming
`Marionette.Object = Marionette.Controller;`


This library is tested with v2.2+ and a mix of underscore and lodash versions.

Marionette.Toolkit supports IE8+ and modern browsers.
