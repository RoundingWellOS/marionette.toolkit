## About Marionette.Toolkit

Marionette.Toolkit is a collection of opinionated extensions for
[Marionette](http://marionettejs.com) Each element helps to reduce boilerplate
for complex large scale application problems.  This toolkit was
built from scripts open sourced from [RoundingWell.com](http://roundingwell.com).


## Documentation
  [StateClass](./docs/state-class.md) - `Marionette.Object` with a `Backbone.Model` for keeping state.

  [Component](./docs/component.md) - Reusable `StateClass` with `View` management boilerplate

  [AbstractApp](./docs/abstract-app.md) - Object including a start/stop lifecycle and running event registry.

  [App](./docs/app.md) - `AbstractApp` with mixed in "App Manager" for adding and removing child `App`s

#### Compatibility and Requirements

Marionette.Toolkit currently requires [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com) 2.1.0+ as it extends
[`Marionette.Object`](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.object.md)
