## About Marionette.Toolkit

Marionette.Toolkit is a collection of opinionated extensions for
[Marionette](http://marionettejs.com) Each element helps to reduce boilerplate
for complex large scale application problems.  This toolkit was
built from scripts open sourced from [RoundingWell.com](http://roundingwell.com).

In addition to the full library, each element in Toolkit is available as it's own [npm module](marionette.toolkit-modularized).
